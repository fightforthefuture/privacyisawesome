				<h1 class="ospdin">Privacy is awesome.</h1>
				<div class="because">
					<h2>Because...</h2>
					<p>Privacy means you can be yourself.  You can express ideas without fear of being discriminated against or unjustly punished. It's your life without pausing to think who's watching: party hard, open up to a friend, organize a revolution, hang out with whoever you want--privacy keeps you safe.  It's a core principle in any free society.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="but">
					<h2>But...</h2>
					<p>Congress is moving bills (CISPA, Lieberman-Collins/Cyber Security Act) that would end meaningful privacy. Your texts, your emails.... shared by corporations, in the hands of government with scant limits. Goodbye privacy, hello police state. We need to kill their plans. </p>
				</div>

				<div class="take">
					<p>	Take  5  steps to kill CISPA, the Cyber Security Act and the SECURE IT Act and save privacy</p>

				<p class="instructions"><strong>We can kill CISPA, the Cyber Security Act and the SECURE IT Act like we killed SOPA, but we've got just one shot -- Memorial Day recess.</strong> The Senate votes on the bill in early June. That doesn't give us much time, but if thousands of people call now, we can win. In short, call the Senate in droves, meet with them. We beat CISPA, the Cyber Security Act and the SECURE IT Act.</p>

					<p class="details">Call your senators, tell them you oppose Lieberman-Collins, and ask for a meeting during the Memorial Day recess.  This tells Senators that their constituents strongly oppose the bill. And it's the first step to getting a constituent meeting, perhaps the most powerful way to change a Senator's mind (if you can't do a meeting, no problem, others can--just get a date and time!)

								<p>I am writing to you as your constituent. I strongly disagree with cybersecurity legislation that would put my privacy at risk. I am asking the Senator to vote NO on S. 2105, the SECURE IT Act, or any cybersecurity bill that infringes on my civil liberties. The right to privacy is very importnat to me, and I think there are better approaches to cybersecurity. We are requesting a meeting with the Senator for my group to speak to him. I would also like to know about any public events or if staff are available to meet with me. What is the best way to go about that?</p>

The same team organized dozens of Senate meetings to stop SOPA/PIPA.  Their budget, including web dev & design: $10,000.  A donor (Bob Fertik of <a href="http://democrats.com">Democrats.com</a>) will match your donations up to $5,000.  If you can, please, chip in.</p>

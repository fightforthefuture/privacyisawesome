				<h1 class="ospdin">Privacy is awesome.</h1>
				<div class="because">
					<h2>Because...</h2>
					<p>Privacy means you can be yourself. You can express your ideas without fear of being discriminated against or unjustly punished.  It's your life without pausing to think who's watching you: wear bread as a hat if you want, read gossip on HuffPo, organize a revolution, hatng out with whoever you want, it's up to you.  And it's one of the core principles our country is founded on.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="but">
					<h2>But...</h2>
					<p>Congress is moving bills (CISPA and Lieberman-Collins) that would end meaningful privacy. Your texts, your emails.... shared by corporations, in the hands of government without limits. Goodbye privacy, hello police state. We need to kill their plans. </p>

				<p class="instructions"><strong>We can kill CISPA like we killed SOPA</strong>, but we've got just one shot -- Memorial Day recess. The Senate votes on the bill in early June. That doesn't give us much time, but if thousands of people call now, we can win. In short, call the Senate in droves, meet with them. We beat CISPA.</p>

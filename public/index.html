				<div class="because">
					<h2>Because...</h2>
					<p>Privacy means you can be yourself. You can express your ideas without fear of being discriminated against or unjustly punished.  It's your life without pausing to think who's watching you: wear bread as a hat if you want, read gossip on HuffPo, organize a revolution, hatng out with whoever you want, it's up to you.  And it's one of the core principles our country is founded on.</p>

				<div class="but">
					<h2>But...</h2>
					<p>Congress is moving bills (CISPA and Lieberman-Collins) that would end meaningful privacy. Your texts, your emails.... shared by corporations, in the hands of government without limits. Goodbye privacy, hello police state. We need to kill their plans. </p>

That doesn't give us much time, but if thousands of people call now, we can win. In short, call the Senate in droves, meet with them. We beat CISPA.</p>

Right now we just need everyone to request meeting times; we'll do the actual organizing later. This is the single most effective thing we can do right now.</p>

								<p>I am writing to you as your constituent. I strongly disagree with cybersecurity legislation that would put my privacy at risk. I am asking the Senator to vote NO on S. 2105 or any cybersecurity bill that infringes on my civil liberties. The right to privacy is very importnat to me, and I think there are better approaches to cybersecurity. We are requesting a meeting with the Senator for my group to speak to him. What is the best way to go about that?"  </p>
